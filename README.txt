DESCRIPTION AND BENEFITS
------------------------

The QA Checklist module provides a list of good QA actions that you should
take to maximize the presence of your website in the major search engines. It
provides little functionality itself but rather it helps you keep track of what
needs to be done and what has been completed already.

Search Engines Drive 90% of the traffic on the web. The more "findable" you are,
the easier it is for you to get customers. This module helps you with on-page
QA - a necessary component of a good online marketing campaign.


INSTALLATION AND USAGE
----------------------

See http://drupal.org/getting-started/5/install-contrib for instructions on
how to install or update Drupal modules.

Summary:
1. Download and extract the module package into your sites/all/modules directory.
2. Go to admin/build/modules and enable the "QA Checklist" module which should
   be in the 'Other' category.
3. To start using the QA Checklist, go to admin/settings/qachecklist. The
   module should automatically check if you have already installed any of the
   modules required for a task.
4. Start checking off some tasks!

Optional:
- Install the Vertical Tabs module (http://drupal.org/project/vertical_tabs) to
  help improve your QA Checklist interface. It helps collapse the interface
  into vertical tabs instead of one huge long list of fieldsets. This module
  also works on the add or edit content forms, which is helpful for your site's
  content creators and editors!
