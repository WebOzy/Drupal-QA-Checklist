{"name":"Drupal QA Checklist","tagline":"GitHub repo for https://www.drupal.org/project/qa_checklist","body":"# Textual overview of checklist\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\n### How to use the Drupal QA Checklist\r\n\r\nThe following will help in your use of the QA Checklist.\r\nInformation\r\n\r\nThis module was written for Drupal site builders, developers, and System administrators or anyone else in charge of launching a Drupal site. The tasks within represent a comprehensive list of things to review and tasks to perform before going live. If you need help with Drupal SEO best practices, the search engines' latest changes, your brand's target audience, or strategic marketing objectives, consider using a Drupal development shop consultant like [WebOzy](http://webozy.com/) or others listed in the [Marketplace](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-services).\r\n\r\n### A bit about checklists\r\n\r\nEach time you open the QAChecklist, it will look to see if any tasks have already been completed. For example, if you've already turned on clean URLs then that item will be checked. You still need to click \"Save\" to time and date stamp the automatically-checked items.\r\n\r\nThe tasks here are designed to be done sequentially, from top to bottom.\r\n\r\n### Don’t do it all\r\n\r\nNot every task in this list needs to, or even should, be done. Some of this will rely on your web host or PAAS provider. Using a Drupal-optimized provider such as Pantheon means that much of this list is already completed. Sit back and enjoy some iced tea. For standard web hosts, you may want to ask about the availability of certain points.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nThe Drupal QA Checklist was created by [Nicholas Garofalo (Eidolon Night)](https://www.drupal.org/user/191336), the CTO of WebOzy, Inc. and other staff members. Special thanks to [Travis Carden](https://www.drupal.org/user/236758) who created the [Checklist API](https://www.drupal.org/project/checklistapi) and ported the 7.x-1.x branch.\r\n\r\n> #### Notes\r\n>\r\n> - Be sure to click the **save** button after you check off each item. This will create a time and date stamp so that you can easily see when each task was completed.\r\n> - Some items have \"More info\" links. These will take you to appropriate documentation pages where you can read more about a module or important concept.\r\n> - “Review” means to check over, the usual settings may be fine\r\n>     - **define**:*review* - to examine or assess (something) formally with the possibility or intention of instituting change if necessary. \r\n\r\n## Deployment\r\n\r\n- Deploy code to live server\r\n    - This checklist is meant to be performed on your live environment\r\n\r\n## Other checklists (optional)\r\nThese are other checklists that would be good to complete.\r\n\r\n- Security Review\r\n    - Check the site for common Drupal security risks.\r\n    - PROJECT LINK\r\n- SEO Checklist\r\n    - Add some modules to help with SEO best practices.\r\n    - PROJECT LINK\r\n- Site Audit\r\n    - Drupal static site analysis platform that generates reports with actionable best practice recommendations.\r\n    - PROJECT LINK\r\n- Performance and scalability checklist\r\n    - Drupal static site analysis platform that generates reports with actionable best practice recommendations.\r\n    - PROJECT LINK\r\n\r\n## Backups\r\nA good backup strategy prevents you from having a really bad day.\r\n\r\n- Install Backup and Migrate\r\n    - This will help with your database backups if your host/PAAS doesn't do it for you.\r\n    - PROJECT LINK\r\n- Install Backup and Migrate Files\r\n    - This addon helps backs up for files if your host/PAAS doesn't do it for you.\r\n    - PROJECT LINK\r\n- Configure Backup and Migrate settings\r\n    - DESCRIPTION\r\n    - PROJECT LINK\r\n- Configure server-side backups\r\n    - Using your hosts server-side backups ensures that you also save server configuration\r\n\r\n## Maintenance\r\nYou want to make sure that your site keeps performing well, these steps help you do just that.\r\n\r\n- Install DB Maintenance\r\n    - Keep your database clean and running smoothly.
