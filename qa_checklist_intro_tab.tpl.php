<h3>How to use the Drupal QA Checklist</h3>
<p>The following will help in your use of the QA Checklist.</p>

<h4>Information</h4>

<p>This module was written for Drupal site builders, developers, and System administrators or anyone else in charge of launching a Drupal site. The tasks within represent a comprehensive list of things to review and tasks to perform before going live. If you need help with Drupal SEO best practices, the search engines' latest changes, your brand's target audience, or strategic marketing objectives, consider using a Drupal development shop consultant like WebOzy or others listed HERE.</p>

<h4>A bit about checklists</h4>

<p>Each time you open the QAChecklist, it will look to see if any tasks have already been completed. For example, if you've already turned on clean URLs then that item will be checked. You still need to click "Save" to time and date stamp the automatically-checked items.</p>

<p>The tasks here are designed to be done sequentially, from top to bottom.</p>

<h4>How this works</h4>

<p>lorem</p>

<h4>Don't do it all</h4>
<p>Not every task in this list needs to, or even should, be done. Some of this will rely on your web host or PAAS provider. Using a Drupal-optimized provider such as Pantheon means that much of this list is already completed. Sit back and enjoy some iced tea. For standard web hosts, you may want to ask about the availability of certain points.</p>

<h4>Credits</h4>
<p>The Drupal QA Checklist was created by Nicholas Garofalo (Eidolon Night), the CTO of WebOzy, Inc. and other staff members. Development was paid for exclusively by Volacci. Special thanks to Travis Carden who created the Checklist API and ported the 7.x-1.x branch.</p>
